**Your choice:** _____

### Push-back Style (1-4)
How much should your pair question your decisions?

- [ ] 1 - Trust my judgment (only push back on clear issues)

- [ ] 4 - Devil's advocate (always present alternatives)

**Your choice:** _____

### Agile Intensity (1-4)

- [ ] 4 - Best friend who codes

**Your choice:** _____

## Step 3: Write Your Reference Guide

Now take your favorites from Step 1 and describe when to use them:

```markdown
### Make Smart References (When Appropriate)
When the moment calls for it, draw from the shared library:
- **[Show/Movie 1]**: [When to use it - e.g., "Perfect for discussing technical debt"]
- **[Show/Movie 2]**: [Context - e.g., "Good for over-engineering jokes"]
- **[Comedian 1]**: [Style - e.g., "Truth-telling about complexity"]
- **[Comedian 2]**: [Approach - e.g., "Story-based explanations"]
- **[Other Influence]**: [Usage - e.g., "Rare, but for meaningful moments"]
```

## Step 4: Create Example Roasts

Write 2-3 example roasts that match YOUR reference library:

**Example 1:**
```markdown
- User: "[Something silly they might say]"
  You: "[Your roast using your references] [Then actual helpful advice]"
```

**Example 2:**
```markdown
- User: "[Another silly thing]"
  You: "[Your roast] [Then guidance]"
```

**Example 3:**
```markdown
- User: "[One more]"
  You: "[Your roast] [Then solution]"
```

## Step 5: Define Your Opening Reference

Create an opening paragraph that uses YOUR references to set the tone:

```markdown
Like [CHARACTER/SHOW], you're [QUALITY]. Like [ANOTHER REFERENCE], you're [QUALITY].
Like [COMEDIAN/SHOW], you [BEHAVIOR]. And like [FINAL REFERENCE], you [CHARACTERISTIC].
```

**Your version:**

________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________

## Step 6: Apply Your Customizations

Now edit your `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/perfect-pair.mdc` file:

1. **Replace the "Core Philosophy" opening** with your version from Step 5
2. **Replace the "Make Smart References" section** with your version from Step 3
3. **Replace the roasting examples** with your versions from Step 4
4. **Adjust tone based on your choices** from Step 2:
   - Roast Level: More/fewer roast examples and stronger/gentler language
   - Push-back: Adjust "When to Push Back" section intensity
   - Agile: Strengthen/soften the "Agile Mindset" section
   - Formality: Change "Talk like a peer" to match your preference

## Step 7: Test and Iterate

Try it out! After a few coding sessions:

- What references landed well?
- What felt forced?
- Too much/too little roasting?
- Right level of push-back?

Adjust and iterate - just like code!
